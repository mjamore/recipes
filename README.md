# Family Recipes Application
This is a web application that will have all of our family recipes listed with pictures, ingredient lists, and cooking directions.


### To-Do:
	- Get Gulp set up to do other cool shit
		- Minify HTML - gulp-minify-html
		- Minify images
		- Run unit tests
		- Minify and concat. JS files
		- Autoprefixer
		- Setup gulp-notify - https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-notify

	- Switch Bootstrap over to Sass
	- Update model to read from MongoDB
	- Learn how to set different meta data for different page
	- create login system and move model to database - render data on page from db
	- Add ability to add new recipes and edit current recipes
	- Create new Mongo collections for category and tags
	- Add count of currently filtered/listed recipes
	- Limit category for new recipe entries to the categories that already exist in the database
	- Fix modal animation
	- Make stateful modal windows so each recipe with have a unique URL
	- Gulp doesn't appear to be concatonating CSS/JS into single file
	- Start serving the index.html from the dist directory.  Will need to have access to the views directory.
	- Allow HTML inside of recipes (i.e. inside of recipe directions)
	- Update view to center title/image when less than 768px
	- Add login check so only authorized users (me, mom, Paul, Nancy) can perform CRUD operations


### Completed:
	√ Only show 'Tags:' label on search results if tags exists on object
	√ Remove comma after last word in search results - ingredients/tags
	√ Fix issue where clicking on modal background (.modal) does not change url
	√ Make category and tag filters dynamically generated from model
	√ Get 'X' added to Bootstrap modal window
	√ Render quick filter buttons based on data in the model
	√ Display owner on recipe card
	√ Split Sass into separate files
	√ Setup live reload
	√ Make sure recipes are sorted alphabetically by category
	√ Sort tag quick filters alphabetically
	√ When filtering the recipeSearchResults, the index is changing, so the modal shows the wrong recipe.  Additionally, the sorting is causing the same issue.


### Bugs:
	- When using quick filters, make the filter only apply to the category/tag.  Right now it filters by all text within the recipe.


### Feature Requests:
	- Different users
		- Only the owner of a recipe can modify it
		- Each recipe name + owner will be unique (i.e. Brenda's baked maccaroni, Paul's baked maccaroni, Nancy's baked maccaroni, etc.)

	- Option 1:
		- Run 'npm install'
