	- Add ability to add new recipes and edit current recipes
	- Create new Mongo collections for category and tags
	- Add count of currently filtered/listed recipes
	- Make sure recipes are sorted alphabetically by category
	- Sort tag quick filters alphabetically
	- Limit category for new recipe entries to the categories that already exist in the database
	- Fix modal animation
	- Make stateful modal windows so each recipe with have a unique URL
	- Gulp doesn't appear to be concatonating CSS/JS into single file
